## How to Use This Skill

### For Creating the Signup Form UI

When you give this skill to an AI to create the form:

```
"Create the signup form using the signup-form-creation skill. 
Generate HTML form structure with proper field types, validations, 
and dynamic behaviors. Use Bootstrap for responsive layout. 
Focus on the form structure only - no API integration yet."
```

### AI Will Understand

1. **Field Structure**: Exact field names, types, validation rules, placeholders
2. **Dynamic Behaviors**: When to show/hide fields based on user selections
3. **Validation Rules**: Required fields, format validation, custom rules
4. **User Experience**: Progressive disclosure, helpful hints, error messages
5. **Data Flow**: Form submission endpoints, field mapping, pre-population support

### Key Dynamic Patterns to Understand

```
// Formation Country triggers Formation State visibility
Formation Country = "1" (US) → Show Formation State field

// Industry selection triggers Industry Other field
Industry Type = "Other" → Show Industry Type Other field

// Revenue Model checkbox triggers Subscription Frequency
Subscription selected → Show Subscription Frequency dropdown
Subscription Frequency = "3" (Other) → Show Subscription Frequency Other

// Ownership percentage affects second owner visibility
Owner 1 Ownership < 50% → Show Owner 2 section + hint

// Referral source affects detail field
"How did you find us" IN [Other, Friend, Live Event] → Show Additional Information

// Bad experience affects provider field
Bad experience = "Yes" → Show provider name field

// Country affects banking fields
Country = "Canada" → Show Institution Number & Currency
```

field: { required: true, validate_email: true }

// URL validation
field: { required: true, validUrl: true }

// Phone validation (intl-tel-input)
field: { required: true, validatePhone: true }

// Currency with custom max
field: { required: true, ValidateAnnualSales: true }

// Percentage distribution (sum to 100%)
field: { validPercentage: true, maxPercentage: true }

// Text length constraints
field: { required: true, minlength: 5, maxlength: 60 }

// Numeric bounds
field: { required: true, min: 1, max: 100 }
```

## API Integration

### Dropdown Data Sources
All dropdown values are fetched from REST APIs:

**Base URL**: `/api/partner`

**Endpoints**:
- `GET /api/partner/countries` - Formation Country (Step 1) & Company Country (Step 2)
- `GET /api/partner/states` - Formation State (Step 1, conditional on US)
- `GET /api/partner/industry-types` - Industry Type (Step 2)
- `GET /api/partner/referral-sources` - How did you find us (Step 6)
- `GET /api/partner/shopping-carts` - Transaction Device (Step 6)
- `GET /api/partner/interest-details` - Help Your Company Grow (Step 6)

**Response Format**:
```json
{
  "data": [
    { "slug": "value_code", "name": "Display Label" }
  ]
}
```

**Implementation**:
- Use `slug` as form field value
- Use `name` as dropdown display label
- See `API_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` for complete implementation details

### Auto-Save Behavior

**Step 1 Only** (when from_lander = true):
- Triggers when all required fields are filled
- On blur from last field
- Debounced to prevent rapid requests
- Endpoint: POST /signup/auto-save

## Pre-Population Support

Many fields can be pre-populated from:
- User authentication data (first name, last name, email)
- External APIs (company info, address via Google Maps)
- Cookies/session (referral codes, partner info)
- Previous form saves

Check `isAuto()` and `autoSourceText()` helper patterns in skill.

## Context Window Tips

This skill is optimized for context efficiency:

1. **Organized hierarchy**: Steps → Cards → Fields
2. **No duplication**: Partials referenced with descriptions
3. **Reusable patterns**: Common validation/formatting rules
4. **Data model example**: JSON structure for field definitions
5. **Reference tables**: Step-by-step field count and complexity
6. **Testing checklist**: All dynamic scenarios listed

**Total Skill Size**: ~24KB
**Estimated Token Usage**: ~6,000 tokens
**Optimized For**: Single passing to AI to generate complete form

## Example Usage in Prompt
