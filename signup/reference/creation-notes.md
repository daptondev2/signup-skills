## 💡 Key Dynamic Patterns (For Your Reference)

### Formation Country → Formation State
```javascript
country = "1" (US) → Show state field
country ≠ "1" → Hide state field
```

### Industry Type → Industry Other
```javascript
industry_type = "other_option" → Show industry_type_other field
```

### Revenue Model → Subscription Fields
```javascript
marketingModel includes 2 (Subscription) → Show subscription_frequency
subscription_frequency = "3" (Other) → Show subscription_frequency_other
```

### Owner 1 Ownership → Owner 2 Visibility
```javascript
owner[1][ownership_percentage] < 50 → Show owner 2 section + hint
```

### Referral Source → Additional Info
```javascript
howdidyouhear IN ["50", "14", "8"] (Other/Friend/Event) 
  → Show hear_about_us_other field
```

### Bad Experience → Provider Detail
```javascript
bad_experience = "1" (Yes) → Show bad_experience_happened field
```

### Country → Banking Fields (Canada)
```javascript
country = "2" (Canada) → Show institution_number & customer_pay_currency
```
