## 🔧 For QA: Testing Framework

### Test Order

**Phase 1: Individual Step Testing**
```
✓ Step 1: 9 fields - Account info
✓ Step 2: 28 fields - Company info with autocomplete
✓ Step 3: 13 fields - Product info with slider
✓ Step 4: 32+ fields - Owner info with Owner 2 conditional
✓ Step 5: 10 fields - Banking info
✓ Step 6: 11 fields - Final details
✓ Step 7: Display only - Signature
```

**Phase 2: Autocomplete Testing** (NEW in Step 2)
```
✓ Legal address autocomplete shows initially
✓ Selecting address auto-populates all 6 fields
✓ Autocomplete hides after selection
✓ Address fields become required
✓ Physical address autocomplete shows when radio="yes"
✓ Selecting physical address auto-populates 6 fields
✓ Country selectpicker refreshes correctly
```

**Phase 3: Conditional Field Testing** (Use DEPENDENT_FIELDS.md)
```
✓ State dropdown (Step 1) - appears when country=US
✓ Revenue model (Step 2) - checkbox array with nesting
✓ Subscription frequency (Step 2 Level 2) - nested conditional
✓ Physical address section (Step 2) - shown when radio="yes"
✓ Fulfillment vendor (Step 3)
✓ Shopping cart other (Step 3)
✓ Owner 2 section (Step 4) - appears when ownership < 51%
✓ Country-specific fields (Step 5)
✓ Conditional text fields (Step 6)
```

**Phase 4: API Integration Testing** (Use api-examples.md)
```
✓ Dropdown data loads (6 GET calls)
✓ Form submission succeeds (3 POST calls)
✓ UUID persists correctly
✓ Error handling works (422, 401, 403, 500)
✓ Validation messages display
✓ Different headers used (Authorization vs X-API-Key)
```

**Phase 5: End-to-End Testing**
```
✓ Complete form with all fields
✓ Submit all 7 steps
✓ Verify database records created
✓ Check email sent
✓ Confirm redirect to dashboard
✓ Test with different countries
```

## 🚀 Quick Reference: Most Important Things

### The Two Headers (DON'T GET WRONG!)

```javascript
// FOR FORM SUBMISSION (POST)
headers: {
    'X-API-Key': user.security_key  // ← X-API-Key
}

// FOR DROPDOWN DATA (GET)
headers: {
    'Authorization': user.security_key  // ← Authorization (different!)
}
```

### The Country/State Logic

```javascript
// Country IDs:
1 = United States (show state dropdown)
2 = Canada (hide state dropdown)
3+ = Other countries (hide state dropdown)

// When to show state:
if (country_id === "1") {
    show(".usa_state");  // Show state selector
}
```

### The Physical Address Logic

```
Radio value "no" (default) = Physical address is SAME as legal
  → Physical address section HIDDEN
  → Do NOT submit physical address data
  → Submit: is_physical_address_same_as_legal_address: 1

Radio value "yes" = Physical address is DIFFERENT from legal
  → Physical address section SHOWN
  → Show Google autocomplete for physical address
  → On autocomplete selection, auto-populate 6 fields
  → DO submit physical address data
  → Submit: is_physical_address_same_as_legal_address: 0
```

### The Google Maps Autocomplete Logic

```
LEGAL ADDRESS:
1. Autocomplete textbox shown initially (if no data exists)
2. User searches and selects address from dropdown
3. All 6 address fields auto-populate from Google place object
4. Autocomplete hides, address fields become visible + required

PHYSICAL ADDRESS:
1. Only shown if radio="yes" (different address)
2. Autocomplete textbox shown initially (if no data exists)
3. User searches and selects address from dropdown
4. All 6 physical address fields auto-populate from Google place object
5. Autocomplete hides, address fields become visible + required
```

### The Slider Rules

```javascript
// Slider MUST:
- Only allow values: 0, 5, 10, 15... 100
- Sum all three to exactly 100%
- Have step: 5 configured
- Real-time percentage display

// Three fields:
card_swiped (point of sale)
customer_entered (online)
staff_entered (manually)
```

### The Owner 2 Conditional

```javascript
// Show Owner 2 if:
ownership_percentage_of_owner_1 < 51

// Hide Owner 2 if:
ownership_percentage_of_owner_1 >= 51

// When visible:
All fields required
Must fill name, email, phone, etc.
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use cURL for quick API testing**
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "https://emap.epd.dev/api/partner/countries" \
     -H "Authorization: YOUR_API_KEY"
   ```

2. **Check browser console for errors**
   - Look for dependent-fields.js errors
   - Check Google Maps API errors
   - Monitor network tab for failed requests

3. **Test on real data**
   - Don't just hardcode test values
   - Use actual API responses
   - Test with edge cases (long names, special characters)

4. **Verify localStorage**
   - UUID should persist between page refreshes
   - Check DevTools → Application → localStorage
   - Clear cache if form state broken

5. **Use the testing checklist**
   - Mark off tests as you go
   - Don't skip "optional" features
   - Test both happy path and error cases
